# Python OOP Examples Collection

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts with practical implementations.

## Contents

1. **Basic OOP Examples**
   - `Exercise.py`: Simple rectangle class with area calculation
   - `oop.py`: Inheritance example with medical treatment classes
   - `Quiz Examples.py`: Pyramid class demonstrating inheritance

2. **GUI Applications with OOP**
   - `Sick.py`: Medical treatment cost calculator with Tkinter GUI
   - `Task 1.py`: Basic medical system interface (incomplete implementation)
   - `Ticket.py`: Ticket sales system with Tkinter GUI

## Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- Classes and objects
- Inheritance (`Cancer` and `Influenza` inheriting from `Sick`)
- Encapsulation (private attributes and methods)
- Polymorphism (method overriding in child classes)
- Abstraction (using abstract base classes)
- GUI programming with OOP (Tkinter examples)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-oop-examples.git
   cd python-oop-examples
